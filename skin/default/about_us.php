<h1>Just simple people...</h1>
<p>
	Event-Biller is a service maintained by JLG Consulting, a French company, composed of 2 persons: Jean-Louis GUENEGO, the owner and 1 employee that helps him.
	Jean-Louis GUENEGO did a stroke in 2009 at 35 years old that left him hemiparetic, but still tries to "entreprendre" things and create jobs.

<h1>...willing to be useful for others.</h1>
<p>
	Event-Biller wants to be useful for helping non profit organizations in the handicap fields.
	We engage ourselves to make donation of 10% of our benefits to associations that are really
	bringing help to handicap in general.
